# GAS x86 syntax
x86 GAS uses reverse order of destination and source registers compared to Intel documentation. This was very confusing.

# Floating point atomics
x86 and ARM64 do not have machine code level support for floating point atomics.

# vadd

vadd is an AARCH32 instruction and hence does not compile in AARCH64 mode.

# AARCH Separate Floating point registers

Floating point register set (Q0-Q32) in AARCH is seperate from the main register set (X0-X31).
